## Teaching Philosophy

I believe deeply in the capacity of students to learn and in education as a force that can meaningfully change lives. My teaching is guided by the conviction that rigorous training in political analysis empowers students not only to understand the world, but to engage it more thoughtfully and effectively. I aim to create an inclusive classroom environment that challenges students intellectually while supporting their development as independent thinkers, equipping them with skills that extend well beyond the classroom.
