## About

I am a PhD candidate at Pennsylvania State University 

My research focuses on political institutions, public policy, and quantitative methods, with particular emphasis on causal inference and democratic governance.

My work examines how law, institutions, and political incentives shape
distributional outcomes and democratic participation.
